    <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Shipping Policy for Donations - Not Applicable:</strong> </p>

    <p>Vrikshami is a platform for tree adoption and environmental donations. We are not an e-commerce store selling physical goods, and therefore <strong>do not offer shipping for any physical products.</strong></p>

    <p>When you make a donation through Vrikshami, you are supporting the tree planting and conservation efforts of our partner Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  </p>

    <p><strong>What you receive upon donation:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digital Certificate of Adoption:</strong> After a successful donation, you will receive a digital certificate of appreciation, usually via email or downloadable from our website (as per specific NGO or platform features).  This certificate is delivered electronically, not physically shipped.</li>
        <li><strong>No Physical Products:</strong> Please note again that no physical products or items are shipped to you as part of the tree adoption donation process. Your donation is directly used to support environmental projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This Shipping Policy is provided for informational purposes and to comply with website policy requirements.  It clarifies that <strong>no shipping of physical goods is applicable to the services provided by Vrikshami.</strong></p>
