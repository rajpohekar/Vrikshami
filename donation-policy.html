    <h1>Donation Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Placeholder Donation Policy:</strong> This policy is for demonstration purposes for Razorpay Go-Live
        application only. A complete, detailed Donation Policy will be implemented for the live website.</p>

    <p>Thank you for supporting Vrikshami and our partner NGOs through your generous donations. Please review our
        Donation Policy below.</p>

    <h2>1. Donations are Voluntary</h2>
    <p>All donations made to Vrikshami through our Website are voluntary contributions towards the environmental
        conservation efforts of our listed partner Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). You are donating to support
        their important work in reforestation and related projects.</p>

    <h2>2. Refunds (Generally Not Applicable for Donations)</h2>
    <p>As donations are charitable contributions supporting NGO projects, <strong>generally, donations are
            non-refundable.</strong> Please ensure you intend to donate before completing your transaction.

    <p><strong>In Exceptional Circumstances:</strong> In very exceptional cases, such as a clear processing error or
        accidental duplicate donation, please contact us at <a
            href="mailto:contact@vrikshami.org">contact@vrikshami.org</a> as soon as possible, and we will review your
        request on a case-by-case basis. Any refunds granted will be at our discretion.</p>

    <h2>3. Donation Receipts and Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>You will receive a confirmation email acknowledging your donation after your transaction is processed. This
        confirmation email serves as your receipt for donation purposes.</p>
    <p>You may receive further updates or acknowledgements from the partner NGO you have chosen to support directly,
        depending on their individual practices, but Vrikshami primarily issues the initial donation receipt.</p>


    <h2>4. Contact Us Regarding Donations</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about your donation, please contact us at <a
            href="mailto:contact@vrikshami.org">contact@vrikshami.org</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you again for your support!</p>
